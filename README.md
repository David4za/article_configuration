# article_configuration

This is the first attempt at creating a dashboard to streamline article creation for the team.

As of 2025.05.15 we currently have a two functioning configurators - Dunk & Thom

Dunk is the most advanced howver - the team wants pricing calculations inserted. This is the next step.
Thom current has both XD and HD working - howver, this is still fairly alpha and wil require additional tweaks.
